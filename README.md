Download phantomjs from the link below and update the webdriver path
in scrape.py accordingly:
http://phantomjs.org/download.html

If you want to watch it in action, use a chrome webdriver:
https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

Also fill in config.json with your login info and 'chmod 700 config.json'
so that nobody can steal your practice problems
